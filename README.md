About the project:

## Inspiration
After the pandemic, the creators of this project (Aryan and Dylan) had originally struggled to regain academic momentum. As others went through similar experiences, we developed technology that would enhance learning and make education accessible.

## What it does
BrainBoostAI can transcribe lectures, extract key topics, and suggest personalized videos based on the content material in order to help students understand and retain educational concepts with better efficiency.

## How we built it
Google's Natural Language Processing AI was used for entity analysis and we implemented speech recognition technology to transcribe words out of a lecture. We also developed a system for recommending personalized YouTube videos based on the extracted keywords.

## Challenges we ran into
We are proud of developing a functioning prototype that can successfully transcribe lectures and provide valuable study resources. When we embarked on this project, it was meant to cater to an urgent need we believed some students had. Being set up correctly, our technology could shape education outcomes.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of developing a functioning prototype that can successfully transcribe lectures and provide valuable study resources. Our goal when creating the project was to target a critical necessity for some students. With our technology set up properly, it has the potential to impact educational outcomes.

## What we learned
Natural language processing, speech recognition, and the difficulties/complexities of implementing certain API's were things we learned while we were developing the project. Additionally, we learned about the importance of iterative testing feedback and user experience design.

## What's next for BrainBoostAI
To improve the userâ€™s experience, our algorithms will undergo fine-tuning to make them more accurate. We also intend to enhance this project by taking others' feedback and improving the user interface.
